            <p>The state of Utah is known for its natural arches and the hiking routes that lead to them. Settled by early Mormon Pioneers, would wanted to name the state "Deseret" meaning "honeybee" but later Utah was chosenas the name after the Native American Ute tribe. The Capitol is Salt Lake City, named after the Great Salt Lake which, as the name implies, is a lake containing large amounts of salt.</p>
